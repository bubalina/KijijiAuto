## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in our project, we appreciate your cooperation in responsibly disclosing it to us. To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. Contact our security team immediately by sending an email to [kijijiautowholesale@gmail.com](mailto:kijijiautowholesale@gmail.com). Please do not disclose any vulnerability details publicly.

2. Provide us with a detailed description of the vulnerability, including any steps or proof-of-concept code to reproduce it.

3. Our security team will acknowledge your report within 24 hours and begin investigating the issue.

4. We will maintain ongoing communication with you to provide updates on the progress of the investigation and the steps being taken to address the vulnerability.

5. Once the vulnerability is resolved, we will credit you for your responsible disclosure, if desired.

We kindly request that you follow responsible disclosure practices and refrain from sharing any information about the vulnerability until we have addressed it. We commit to treating all vulnerability reports with strict confidentiality and will prioritize resolving them in a timely manner.

## Bug Bounty Program

At this time, we do not have an active bug bounty program, and we kindly request that you report vulnerabilities without any expectation of financial compensation.

We greatly appreciate your support in helping us ensure the security of our project. Your efforts contribute to creating a safer environment for all users.
